=========

Music streaming interface. Should be easily adaptable to other players.

How does it work?
-----------------

Have a directory say `music` with a limited capacity of `x`. This app will play
the song with the lowest modification date in this directory. (How it should
play this can be abstracted).

The interface should allow people to upload songs into this directory. No
pausing or skipping is allowed! 

REST api
--------

GET /songs => Show song listing

POST /songs => Upload song(s)

Dependencies
------------

- ruby-taglib2
